# Challenge

# What's The Challenge?
The challenge is to create a bash file that first creates a new user group and then creates a new user which is then added to that group. The program then needs to create a file named "run.sh" and enter an echo command into that file. It also needs to make that file only executable by the group created earlier and then switch you to the new user. The final thing for the script to do is to run the script which it has created.

# Challenge Expectations
At first, I expected the challenge to be fairly straight forwards but also to get held up on one or two instructions. My primary concern was setting the permissions of the created file to only be executable to the group created at the beggining.

# What Went Well
Creating the group and user then assigning the user to the group went well and worked first try.

# What Didn't Go To Plan
As expected, the permissions took a while to figure out and made me go and research how the permissions system in linux works in more detail.

# Possible Improvements
For future challenges, I would do more research into the Linux permission system as that is what is holding me back the most when trying to complete the challenge.
